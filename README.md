MTG Cards and other game essentials.

This site is my project for a Web Application Developement course.
The project requirements were for an e-commerce site using technologies including HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, PHP and MySQL.
I chose to make mine themed on a Magic: The Gathering store.

Feel free to copy anything you see here, just put your own spin on it.

The majority of functionality and theming is based on examples on https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/
I also refer to https://www.w3schools.com/ for jQuery/Javascript and MySQL.
